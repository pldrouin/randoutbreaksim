# randoutbreaksim
This project depends on very few libaries, and as such, a simple set of Makefiles is provided
to compile it. The code depends on librngstream from the same author, on libgsl (tested with
version 2.7) and on libpthread. The Makefiles expect the librngstream header files and library
to be located in the directory pointed to by the RNGSDIR environment variable. In order to compile
the project, GNU Make, a C compiler and linker, as well as GNU sed are required.
Additionally, the project supports doxygen to generate code documentation.

The following make variables can be togled (deactivated by default) to enable extra features
for the library and executable:

NUMEVENTSSTATS: Statistics regarding the number of events

CT_OUTPUT: Contact tracing support

OBSREFF_OUTPUT: Output regarding an observed (detected) effective reproduction number in addition to
                the simulated effective reproduction number

DUAL_PINF: Model includes support for a second class of individuals that has a different probability of infection and transmission (e.g. vaccinated individuals)

SEC_INF_TIMELINES (requires DUAL_PINF): Generate timeline statistics as well for the second class of individuals described above.

The Makefiles define the following targets:
AllExecs (default target): Compile library and executable
AllLibs: Compile library
doc: Generate code documentation using doxygen
clean: Delete the intermediate files of the compiling process
clear: Delete both the intermediate and output files of the compiling process
